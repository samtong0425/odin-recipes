        <p>Ziti (Italian: [ˈdziːti]), also zite (Italian: [ˈdziːte]), are a shape of extruded pasta originating from Campania and Sicily, southern Italy. They are shaped into long, wide tubes, about 25 cm (9.8 inches) long, that need to be broken by hand into smaller pieces before cooking. Ziti have similarities to bucatini, but are much thicker.</p>

        <p>A casserole (French: diminutive of casse, from Provençal cassa 'pan'[1]) is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven; it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel. To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a "casserole dish" or "casserole pan", whereas the food is simply "a casserole". The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.</p>
