    <p class="description">The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end. Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!</p>
   
    <H2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</H2>

    <ul class="ingredients">

            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package mild taco seasoning mix</li>          
            <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>          
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powderv</li>          
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>         
            <li>5 (12 inch) flour tortillas</li>         
            <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>         
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="step">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="step">
        <li>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two forks.</li>
        <li>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
